"""
Luraph v15 pipeline (see LURAPH.md).

The protected script runs in the fake environment with every VM closure
instrumented (patch_entries). Checks that cannot be emulated exactly end in
a trap that corrupts the bytecode; the runtime reports which function made
that call and the script runs again with that function turned into a no-op.
Loadstring'd VM chunks are instrumented the same way and passed back.
Then the captured protos are lifted (devirt.py), with constant rounds for
code that never ran.
